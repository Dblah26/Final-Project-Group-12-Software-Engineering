Now looking back on our charts there was a few things that need to be revised just ever so slightly to ensure the app is optimized for the user to get to the scheduling page. While every page has content that would be good for a user and some is important for the user to view to get what packages and services they are interested, it is even more important that every page is pointing directly at the schedule page. While there is information that people can learn and links that can be followed to view and dive deeper the goal no matter what is the one page. We feel that if we work on that we will be able to get the most leads, and the most appointments. Chasing the most appointments is the goal and what every company should be focusing on.
