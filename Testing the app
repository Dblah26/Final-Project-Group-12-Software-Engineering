One very vital piece and process of every well put together project is testing. For our project we tested the app many ways. First of all, we tested the speeds and responsiveness of every page and load query within the app. We strive to make the app have optimal loading times and a quick transition from page to page. Again, it is very important to get the app to lead to one place and that is where they schedule the actual appointment because that is what every business will want. With this in mind we made sure our app is optimized to guide everything to the schedule appointment page. Now, it is very important that once the app has had a customer place an appointment and set something up that the owner will receive. In our app we have the form submission get emailed to the owner and then lists out the complete form so they get every piece of information from the submission. We tested it with many submissions and forms and they all came through as a success and worked great.
