Laying out an individual learning plan per person is something that is very important for every project that one is apart of. This is because sometimes people tend to take leads or do something alone within a project because they are familiar with it while someone else does not even get the chance to learn that topic which could be essential. This is why there are many technical skills that are needed to be learned from this project and many that are needed to do it in the first place. Some technical skills we need now consist of basic coding knowledge, a certain understanding of GitHub so we can maneuver around the site, and basic knowledge of how the systems of the project we chose works. Now, while many of this is new within my group we will need to use every resource we can find to be able to achieve our goals and succeed on this project. Some resources include our professor, other GitHub users, our classmates, and trusted websites. We know we do not need to be an expert but we would like to be able to succeed in what we choose. This is also why we have not set certain timelines on our learning or understanding of these topics and skills. I feel that if we set a time limit then we are stopping and limiting ourselves to a certain amount of learning. Giving it as much time as you can to learn the most and get the most out of this project will really pay off in the end.
