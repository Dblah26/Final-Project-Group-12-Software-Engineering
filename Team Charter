For this project our team charter is complete, we have assigned roles for who will be completing and working on certain parts of the project as a whole and some specific tasks as well. Our personas are similar within the group however we both have different skills as Ray is more focused on languages like C++ while Devin is more on the algorithm side of things. As well as our scenarios, we have broken these down not only into small steps but also who will be doing each small step and how we can work together and towards a common goal the whole time while having our own workload. We both do need to continue to learn more on the GitHub side and the Devops/Sail side. We have ben clear with our features of our project as well however, we will work to continue to add and create more features and functionality. We have assigned rules within our group like due dates and workload for each of us as we would like to ensure we are both giving our all into every assignment we have.
	As we continue to learn and develop the technology stack we believe we will get a better understanding of it as a whole as right now it is a lot to take in for such a large project. A linter has not been selected yet as we have been conducting research to decide what the best plan of attack would be for our group specific project and once we get a grasp on this we will decide the linter. We believe we could setup a machine for developing our project as we have dived deep into our research and our topic of work. For the most part it is clear the automated sections of the testing and the manual and the rules and commits have been defined.
